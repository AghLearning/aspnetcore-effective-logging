# ASP.NET Core -- Effective Logging
This repo contains code that was used (and is kept up-to-date) from the [Effective Logging in ASP.NET Core](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/asp-dotnet-core-effective-logging) course on Pluralsight, which I authored.

It includes references to BOTH Serilog and NLog and various commits will change the logging framework from one to the other.
